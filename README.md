I'm a newly minted software engineer and recent graduate of App Academy's full-stack software engineering course. Previously, I spent four years in technology-focused investment banking and, later, four years in corporate strategy for late stage startups in real estate tech & micromobility. I've managed high performing small to medium-sized teams, excelled as an individual contributor, and love working with passionate people. Always happy to chat -- don't be shy to reach out!
